# cbmr

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of cbmr is to collect and automate many of the routine analyses I perform.
It is still in a very early version and is unlikely to be useful to anyone but me (and maybe people I work with)

## Installation

You can install the package from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("lars-work-sund/cbmr")
```

or alternatively the devlopment version with:
```{r}
devtools::install_github("lars-work-sund/cbmr", ref = "thomas_dev")
```
